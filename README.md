# Salted-Caramel

The years may pass, as you know
where they went, you'll never know
bouts of sad, joy, or glory
you are never too old for a story!

Happy Birthday, I do wish.
to my most favorite of fish.
 

      There was once a dwarf, and his name was Bob.
      and Bob really liked, salted-caramel,
      and fishing.

      Why did he like fishing?
      Because he liked to sit in a boat.

      But he was a dwarf?

      Yeah, he was a dwarf!
      So it was a small boat?
      It was a very small boat.
      Just big enough for a dwarf.
      Mmmhmm.

      And one day, Bob went fishing
      and he caught, a really big tunafish.
      Mmmmm.
      It was too big and Bob didn't know what to do with him

      Make a tunafish sandwich!
      Dwarfs don't think about these things.
      I'd make a tunafish sandwich... with cheddar cheese!
      So what did he do?

      He threw the fish back into the ocean.
      Ahhh.
      And they became really good friends.
      Awww...
      So if you donb't eat your tunafish, 
      you become friends with it
      Only if you're a dwarf.

      And the tunafish also really liked salted-caramel
      and they made salted-caramel together
      in the bottom of the ocean

      How did Bob go to the bottom of the ocean?

      He scuba dived!

      Did they start a company?

      No, it was just for them. It was their own special salted-caramel.
      Who ate more?
      The tunafish.
      Was he bigger?
      Yes, a lot bigger.
      Why didn't he eat Bob? 
      What if he wanted a dwarf sandwich to go with his salted-caramel? What did he need Bob for?
      To bring him brown sugar
      Where did he get that from
      He's a dwarf?
      Where do dwarfs get brown sugar?
      No one knows!

      But, but wouldn't it just melt at the bottom of the ocean?
      That's the point!
      It was the best salted-caramel ever, and they didn't even need to add salt!
      because it was in the ocean.

      Does that make it sea salted-caramel?

      That's exactly right. It was the best sea salted caramel.
      It was made my a tunafish and Bob the dwarf.

      Does that mean if we get you a dwarf, since you're a Gilfish,
      you'll make salted-caramel too?

      Maybe I already have a dwarf!

      Is that the end of the story?
      Yup! That's the end of the story.
      That was a good story.
      They made a lot of caramel together, and they were best friends.
